<h2 align="center"> Command-Line Calculator </h2>

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in TypeScript that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It allows users to interactively input numbers and select operations through the terminal.

## Features
- **Addition**: 
  - Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: 
  - Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: 
  - Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: 
  - Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
- **Exponentiation**: 
  - Raises the first number to the power of the second.
